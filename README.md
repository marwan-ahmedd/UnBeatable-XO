This GitHub repository contains the code for an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using the Minimax algorithm. The game is played between a human player and an AI player, where the AI player uses the Minimax algorithm to determine its moves.

The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in game theory, and it is particularly useful in games with perfect information and a finite number of possible moves. In Tic-Tac-Toe, the Minimax algorithm works by searching through all possible future moves and selecting the move that leads to the best possible outcome for the AI player, assuming that the human player will also make optimal moves.

Key Features:
* An unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using the Minimax algorithm
* Graphical user interface for playing against the AI
* Well-documented Python code for easy understanding and implementation
* Handles user input and validates moves to prevent invalid moves
